      <div class="rules">
        <p>
          To play the dice game, you will need nothing thats the beauty of the
          game. The objective of the game is to be the first player to reach 100
          total points.
        </p>
        <span>Here are the basic rules:</span>
        <ol>
          <li>player 1 starts the game and gets a chance to roll the dice.</li>
          <li>
            If the player rolls a number between 2 and 6, they earn that many
            points for their current account.
          </li>
          <li>
            The player can choose to roll the dice again or end their turn by
            pressing the "hold" button.
          </li>
          <li>
            If the player presses the "hold" button, their current points are
            added to their total points and the next player takes turns
            following the same rules.
          </li>
          <li>
            If the player rolls a 1, their turn ends and the current point
            becomes 0, and no point is added to the total points.
          </li>
          <!-- <li>
            If the player reaches a total of 100 points, they win the game.
          </li>
          <li>
            If the player does not reach 100 points, the next player takes their
            turn following the same rules.
          </li> -->
          <li>The game continues until a player reaches 100 total points.</li>
        </ol>
        <!-- <span
          >Note: The game can be modified depending on the players' preferences
          like winning score, number of dices and number of rounds.</span> -->
